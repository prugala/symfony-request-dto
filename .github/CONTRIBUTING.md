# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/prugala/symfony-request-dto/).

## Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** - If possible, try to add tests to support your patch.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your main branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
